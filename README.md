## Overview

![teaser](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/teaser.jpg)
**Nunchaku** is a high-performance inference engine for low-bit neural networks. It implements **SVDQuant**, a post-training quantization technique for 4-bit weights and activations that well maintains visual fidelity. On 12B FLUX.1-dev, it achieves 3.6Ã— memory reduction compared to the BF16 model. By eliminating CPU offloading, it offers 8.7Ã— speedup over the 16-bit model when on a 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, 3Ã— faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline. On PixArt-âˆ‘, it demonstrates significantly superior visual quality over other W4A4 or even W4A8 baselines. "E2E" means the end-to-end latency including the text encoder and VAE decoder.

## Method

#### Quantization Method -- SVDQuant

![intuition](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/intuition.gif)Overview of SVDQuant. Stage1: Originally, both the activation $\boldsymbol{X}$ and weights $\boldsymbol{W}$ contain outliers, making 4-bit quantization challenging. Stage 2: We migrate the outliers from activations to weights, resulting in the updated activation $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ and weights $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$. While $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ becomes easier to quantize, $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ now becomes more difficult. Stage 3: SVDQuant further decomposes $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ into a low-rank component $\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ and a residual $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}-\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ with SVD. Thus, the quantization difficulty is alleviated by the low-rank branch, which runs at 16-bit precision.

#### Nunchaku Engine Design

![engine](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/engine.jpg) (a) NaÃ¯vely running low-rank branch with rank 32 will introduce 57% latency overhead due to extra read of 16-bit inputs in *Down Projection* and extra write of 16-bit outputs in *Up Projection*. Nunchaku optimizes this overhead with kernel fusion. (b) *Down Projection* and *Quantize* kernels use the same input, while *Up Projection* and *4-Bit Compute* kernels share the same output. To reduce data movement overhead, we fuse the first two and the latter two kernels together.

## Performance

![efficiency](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nunchaku-tech/cdn/resolve/main/nunchaku/assets/efficiency.jpg)SVDQuant reduces the 12B FLUX.1 model size by 3.6Ã— and cuts the 16-bit model's memory usage by 3.5Ã—. With Nunchaku, our INT4 model runs 3.0Ã— faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline on both desktop and laptop NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. Notably, on the laptop 4090, it achieves a total 10.1Ã— speedup by eliminating CPU offloading. Our NVFP4 model is also 3.1Ã— faster than both BF16 and NF4 on the RTX 5090 GPU.
